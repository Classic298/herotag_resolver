# herotag_resolver
Simple script that resolves provided herotags and saves the addresses

# Usage

# Option 1:
Go to the github io page and use it there

# Option 2 (Python)

## Step 1
Create a file named `herotags.txt` in the same folder as the python file.  
Put all of your herotags in it, one herotag per line.

## Step 2
Execute the python file, and watch the magic unfold. You will end up with a `adresses.txt` file in which all the addresses that could be resolved from the herotags are contained.
