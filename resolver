"""This code uses the open function to read the file located at the specified filepath and
the requests library to send a GET request to the Elrond API for each herotag in the file,
one by one. It extracts the "address" field from the JSON response to build a list of addresses.
The print statement at the bottom of the script will output the list of resolved addresses."""
